# Circle of Friends

This is Circle of Friends, a social media app where everybody is
friends with everybody! You are connected to everyone on the app
from the moment you hit "Register." From the get-go, you are 
following (and being followed by) every other user on the app. 
They see all of your posts/comments, and you see all of theirs. 

Features:
    - Infinite scroll; load 10 posts at a time
    - Like and dislike posts
    - Comment on posts
    - React with images in both posts and comments
    - Set a profile picture, which others will see
    - Write a bio in your profile for others to read

To post an image, just paste the link in a post or comment and
send it. When it appears, it will show the image. Supported file
types are .jpg and .png.
